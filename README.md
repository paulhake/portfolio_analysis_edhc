```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## About the Course

This course is part of a four-course specialization in Data Science and Machine Learning in Asset Management but can be taken independently. It covers Nobel Prize-winning concepts and state-of-the-art investment management techniques with emphasis on practical Python implementation.

The approach combines theoretical foundations with hands-on coding, ensuring both conceptual understanding and practical mastery of computational methods in investment management.
